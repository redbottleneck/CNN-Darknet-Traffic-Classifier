# CNN-Darknet-Traffic-Classifier
This project develops a network traffic analyzer to detect Darknet activities (Tor/VPN) using flow metadata from the CIC-Darknet2020 dataset. We contrast a standard Random Forest clas- sifier with a 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) designed for tabular signal processing.
